As we all know that we are going through testing times, our website aims to provide a ray of hope to the user. 
We created a website that provides the user with up to date information regarding the current Covid-19 situation. 
The website extracts data from government approved websites and provides it to the user in a simplified and user-friendly manner. 
We have used one class-based component and all other components are functional components with hooks to the main class. 
The user thus can get an idea about the situation around him and prepare himself better. 
The website provides the user with a number of countries and when the user in turn presses on the countries, it provides them with the break-down of cases in their state.
